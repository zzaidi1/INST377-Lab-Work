<!--
    This is how to build the CSS-only load animation from loading.io    
    <div class="lds-ellipsis"><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

    This is helpful for showing your client-side users when data is loading,
    since there's otherwise no sign your app is thinking about something!

    Try placing it at the same level in your element tree as your Submit button
